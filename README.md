14: Pick an LLM, create connections between movies. Without some more specific usecases, I'm rather uncomfortable with directly searching via LLM. I could limit it to registered users, I could add some sort of rate limits. I'm rather partial towards just LLM'ing movies when they are created.
15: Use the movie relations on the details page for suggestions.
16: Create a browse and search pages with infinite scrolling.
17: Connect the search bar with suggestions.
